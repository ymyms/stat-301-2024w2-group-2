    "Tipping is a widespread social norm in service industries, particularly in restaurants, where it can contribute significantly to employee income. However, tipping behavior is not entirely uniform—numerous studies have found that factors such as customer demographics, situational context, and group dynamics can all influence how much people tip (Jewell, 2008). Understanding what drives tipping behavior is valuable not only for economic modeling, but also for helping restaurant managers and servers improve their service strategies and expectations.\n",
    "\n",
    "This study explores whether variables such as payer’s gender, smoking status, day of the week, time of day, and party size are associated with the tip percentage left in a restaurant setting. Research has shown that, for instance, tipping tends to decrease as party size increases, likely due to a diffusion of responsibility or shared norms within larger groups (Haugom & Thrane, 2022). Similarly, differences in tipping patterns have been observed based on temporal variables like weekday vs. weekend or lunch vs. dinner (Jewell, 2008).\n",

    "Building upon these insights, this study aims to investigate the relationships between specific variables—payer’s gender, smoking status, day of the week, time of day, and dining party size—and tip percentage in a restaurant setting.\n",

    "This study contributes to the existing body of knowledge on tipping behavior by focusing on specific variables that have been identified in prior research as potential influencers of tipping practices. By examining these factors collectively, the study aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of their individual and combined effects on tip percentages."

    "The \"Restaurant Tips Dataset\" details tipping behavior in a restaurant setting. The dataset was collected over an long period of time and includes a variety of factors that may influence the amount a customer tips. Each entry represents a unique transaction, recording details such as the bill amount, tip given, gender of the payer, smoking preference, day of the week, time of day, and number of diners. This data contains 244 observations and 7 variables. The continuous variables are total_bill, tip, and size, while the categorical variables are sex, smoker, day, and time. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset used in this study was collected through observational means, meaning the data reflects real-world restaurant transactions without any experimental manipulation. As such, while we can investigate associations between variables and tip percentage, causal conclusions cannot be drawn."

    "This study opens the door to several potential avenues for future research. One major limitation of the current analysis is the lack of variables related to service quality, customer income level, or restaurant type, all of which could meaningfully influence tipping behavior. Future studies could investigate how interpersonal dynamics, such as server friendliness or attentiveness, interact with customer demographics to affect tipping. Additionally, incorporating longitudinal or transactional data could help explore temporal patterns in tipping, such as whether tipping behavior changes over time or during holidays. Expanding this analysis to a larger, more diverse sample across different cities or restaurant chains could also provide insight into how regional or cultural factors shape tipping norms. Finally, if experimental or quasi-experimental data were available, future work could attempt to move beyond inference toward causal analysis, exploring whether targeted interventions (e.g., menu messaging or suggested tips) actually influence customer tipping decisions."
